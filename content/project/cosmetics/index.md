title: Improving Fairness in Emergency Hospital Admission
subtitle: Boston Children Hospital
date: 2022-01-01
summary: • Evaluated the fairness of selected machine learning models (XGboost/Random Forest/Logistic Regression) on Emergency
Department Admission between different subgroups using differential demography and equalized odds.
• Built a package for fair machine learning algorithm to minimize the difference in model performance between patient
groups using a multi-objective optimization approach without sacrifice overall performance. Developed all the
preprocessing, model fitting, testing, post-processing code and the documentation from scratch in python and pushed to git.
• Achieved promising results on fairness and accuracy metrics on MIMIC and submitted to ICLR conference for review.
