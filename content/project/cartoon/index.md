title: Machine Learning in Prostate Cancer
subtitle: MIT 6.S897 Machine Learning for Health Care Final Project
date: 2022-01-01
summary: 
• Built model with good interpretability (Regression/Random Forest) along with clinician’s expertise to understand what’s the
most influential features that affect the development of Lymph Node Metasis.
• Impute missing data on the important features and response variables with both rule-based method as well as automated
method like RNN and CNN on the clinical text. Have clinician checked for the accuracy. (> 90% are correct)
• Retrained XGboost model on the imputed dataset. Compared the best tuned model with a rule based model on test dataset
and constantly produce more better results (0.9 vs 0.7 acc) on our final model according to the manual check by clinicians.
