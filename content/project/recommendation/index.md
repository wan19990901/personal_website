subtitle: "National Center for Supercomputing Applications "
date: 2022-01-01
summary: 
• Developed bash scripts to automatically run machine learning pipeline (ETL, Model fitting with Pytorch/sklearn) to predict
the outbreak of West Nile Virus based on social-economical, weather, and geological covariates with a giant dataset (100GB).
• Interpreted results and visualized insights gained from the final model (random forest) to the public health experts using
partial dependency plot and achieved a higher F1-score than the previous papers. Paper submitted to PLOS Journal.
• Wrote YML and docker to build a docker file that helps reproduce my code for future work.
