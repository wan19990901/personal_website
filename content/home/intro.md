👋 Hi, there! I'm Guangya Wan 
, a master student in Harvard and also a
machine learning researcher at Boston Childeren Hospital. I am passionate about applying data science methods to tackle different problems in healthcare; in my spare time, I like travelling and photography(especially astrophotography).
