Recommended apps and websites
While we’re not going to be with you to point out objects in the sky, there are plenty of ways to
find them yourself. Technology has become pretty amazing in this regard! One thing: if you’re
going to be using your phone to find options, you should turn on redshift (explainer here for
iPhones). Otherwise your phone screen will ruin your night vision and keep you from seeing the
things you’re looking for!
Here are some apps we recommend:


● Star Walk 2 is a phone planetarium for three dollars. It has lots of detailed information
about when stars and planets will rise and set, and has an artificial reality mode that will
tell you what objects are in the direction that your phone is pointing towards. It also has a
time function, allowing you to see what the sky will look like in fifteen minutes, an hour,
or next month. (These are common features of any good stargazing app – Star Walk 2 just
has nicely polished versions.)


● Night Sky is another great phone app. It’s slightly less intuitive than Star Walk 2, but it’s
free (albeit with a few features locked behind a very expensive premium option) and has
an augmented reality function. It’s also useful for identifying satellites, be they a Starlink

or the ISS. Its biggest con is that it has so many objects that it can be a little
overwhelming and you can lose your overall view.


● Sky Map is a nice simple free phone app. It still will show you all the major
constellations, stars, and planets, but less of the satellites and other smaller details. It’s
particularly great for general situational awareness of the whole sky, since it allows you
to zoom out all the way out and see the bigger picture. Getting oriented like that is super
helpful!


● Stellarium is the best thing to use before you go stargazing. It’s a free and easy-to-use
computer app that has a TON of data about everything in the sky — most my dark
sky trips are planned based on what Stellarium has to say! \
